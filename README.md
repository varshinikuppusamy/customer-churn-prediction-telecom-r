## 🧠 Project Overview

Customer churn represents a major challenge in the telecom industry. This project aims to:
- Analyze customer demographic and behavioral data.
- Identify key factors influencing churn.
- Build predictive models to forecast churn.
- Suggest actionable strategies to retain customers.

## 🔍 Dataset

The dataset was collected through a structured Google Form survey with 100 respondents. It includes:
- Demographics (Age, Gender, Location, Income)
- Service-related experiences (Satisfaction with Network, Billing, Customer Support)
- Churn status (Yes/No)

## 🔬 Machine Learning Models Used

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

All models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-score

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Churn Rate**: 33%
- **Top churn drivers**: Dissatisfaction with billing process, network issues, customer service gaps
- **Best performing models**: Random Forest & SVM (~82% accuracy)
- **Retention Insight**: Even satisfied customers churn, showing the need for deeper engagement strategies.
