# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction in the Telecom Sector Using R

This is my final year MBA project at Bengaluru City University, conducted at the International Institute of Business Studies. The project uses R Programming to build machine learning models for predicting customer churn in the telecom sector.

## 🧠 What This Project Covers
- Predictive modeling using R (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM)
- Data collected from 100 telecom users via Google Forms
- EDA, hypothesis testing, and actionable insights for reducing churn

## 🔧 Tools Used
- R programming
- Libraries: caret, ggplot2, dplyr
- Excel & Google Forms

## 📈 Key Findings
- Churn rate: 33%
- Major churn factors: Billing issues, Network satisfaction
- Random Forest & SVM performed best (Accuracy: 82%)

## 📄 Project Report
Full PDF of my final thesis is available in this repository.
